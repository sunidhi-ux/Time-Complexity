The Time Complexity Analysisme complexity - Binary Search time complexity analysis is done below-In each iteration or in each recursive call, the search gets reduced to half of 
the array. So for n elements in the array, there are log 2 n iterations or recursive calls. 
  Thus, we have- Time Complexity of Binary Search Algorithm is O(log 2 n). Here, n is the number of elements in the sorted linear array.
